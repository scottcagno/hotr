                Building and maintaining a love relationship is a lot like starting and feeding
                a fire. You sparked a friendship, added some kindling through flirting, and as
                you invested more time and energy through dating, you placed larger pieces of
                wood onto the flames making them burn brighter! Soon, you had built a roaring
                fire and got married believing that those fiery feelings of commitment and love
                would never die down. But then reality hits and you realize that if that fire
                isn’t tended, those flames will falter. We want to help you “Fan the Flames” of
                your marriage and turn it into a roaring blaze!
