						<h4>What is a &#8220;Fan the Flame Marriage Intensive&#8221;?</h4>
					</strong>
					<p class="text-white">
						Our marriage intensives are more than a couple&#8217;s weekend retreat.
						They are intimate, personalized coaching sessions designed to help you identify
						and address your specific needs. Intensives are more powerful than one hour counseling
						sessions because they keep you both focused on your issues for an extended period of time.
						You will receive over 20 hours of personalized counseling, coaching and marriage building
						exercises that will fan the flame of your marriage back to life.
