					<strong><h4>Hear what some of our couples are saying about our marriage events:</h4></strong>
					<br>
					<p>
						"It was a pleasure to be with them (Bruce and Karen) during our sessions.  They have an
						authentic and true desire to see our marriage thrive.  Their concern for helping us through the
						areas of our relationship that have been road blocks comes through during the sessions and
						afterwards during the down times of the intensive.  They navigated us through some heated and
						tough discussions to bring us back to the reality that our marriage relationship and covenant
						is for a lifetime.  Letâ€™s focus on the good that can come of out of it.  Enjoyed them and
						continue to appreciate and support their ministry."  - D & A
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						"All I can say is make your reservation today ... my life was changed and yours can be too!!" - J & D
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						"Since the intensive, we have been working very hard to "date" each other. There have been
						almost no arguments, which has been divine. My husband has been calling every night before
						leaving work, so that I know what time to expect him and I am letting him know how much I
						appreciate this. Our plan has included writing scripture on index cards and putting them where
						we can see them. We have been reading the Bible as much as possible, treating each other with
						extra kindness, offering more grace." - G & L
