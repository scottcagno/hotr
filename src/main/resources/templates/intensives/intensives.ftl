							<strong><h4>Hear what some of our couples are saying about our marriage events:</h4></strong>
							<br>
							<p>
								"It was a pleasure to be with them (Bruce and Karen) during our sessions.  They have an
								authentic and true desire to see our marriage thrive.  Their concern for helping us through the
								areas of our relationship that have been road blocks comes through during the sessions and
								afterwards during the down times of the intensive.  They navigated us through some heated and
								tough discussions to bring us back to the reality that our marriage relationship and covenant
								is for a lifetime.  Let’s focus on the good that can come of out of it.  Enjoyed them and
								continue to appreciate and support their ministry."  - D & A
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								"All I can say is make your reservation today ... my life was changed and yours can be too!!" - J & D
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								"Since the intensive, we have been working very hard to "date" each other. There have been
								almost no arguments, which has been divine. My husband has been calling every night before
								leaving work, so that I know what time to expect him and I am letting him know how much I
								appreciate this. Our plan has included writing scripture on index cards and putting them where
								we can see them. We have been reading the Bible as much as possible, treating each other with
								extra kindness, offering more grace." - G & L
