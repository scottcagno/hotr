						<strong><h4>MARRIAGE IS GOOD FOR YOUR POCKETBOOK.</h4></strong>
						<p class="text-white">
							Married men and women earn more and save more than singles or unmarried couples.  Working
							together in a healthy, lifelong partnership, men and women actually produce more, spend less,
							and save and invest more wisely and unattached people – even singles with the same education
							and jobs.  Divorce devastates most family's finances.
