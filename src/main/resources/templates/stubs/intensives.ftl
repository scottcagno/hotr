			<strong><h4>We’re glad you’re here!</h4></strong>
			<p>
				Your being here means that you believe there is still hope for your marriage.
				That’s all we ask … that you can still see a flicker of life … and have a willingness
				to fan that flame back into a meaningful marriage. You owe it to yourself, your
				spouse and your children to make that effort.

				Acknowledging your need for an intervention &#8230; or a miracle &#8230; is the first
				step to transforming your relationship. You might believe you&#8217;re too far apart
				&#8230; too hurt and damaged &#8230; or too far gone to save your marriage. We believe
				that our time together can help you begin to stop the craziness so you can begin putting
				your relationship with God and each other back together again.
			</p>
			<p>
				May we encourage you &#8230; before you choose to extinguish the flame of your marriage forever,
				to make at least one more try?

			<strong><h4>What is a &#8220;Fan the Flame Marriage Intensive&#8221;?</h4></strong>
			<p>
				Our marriage intensives are more than a couple&#8217;s weekend retreat.
				They are intimate, personalized coaching sessions designed to help you identify
				and address your specific needs. Intensives are more powerful than one hour counseling
				sessions because they keep you both focused on your issues for an extended period of time.
				You will receive over 15 hours of personalized counseling, coaching and marriage building
				exercises that will fan the flame of your marriage back to life.
